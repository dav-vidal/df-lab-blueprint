PURPOSE
- Side-by-side diff of two stored units.

OUTPUT
- Per-attribute row:
  NAME, value_A, value_B, delta, class_A, class_B, class_delta
- Summary:
  ELITE_COUNT_A, ELITE_COUNT_B, delta
  HIGH_COUNT_A,  HIGH_COUNT_B,  delta

CLASS_DELTA
- class_delta = index(class_B) - index(class_A)   # -7..+7

OPTIONAL SCORE
- similarity (0..1) using cosine on z-scored attribute vector (PHYS+MENT).
