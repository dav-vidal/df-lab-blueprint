# Validator

PURPOSE
- Ensure creature files are well-formed and usable by the generator/evaluator.

RULES
- CreatureIndex.txt:
  * MAP has uppercase tokens → file paths.
  * DEFAULT exists in MAP.
  * ALLOW_NORMAL_FALLBACK is boolean.

- Creature files (Configs/Creatures/<TOKEN>.txt):
  * First line starts with "# CREATURE:<TOKEN>".
  * ≥1 [CASTE:<NAME>] block exists.
  * Each CASTE block contains:
      BODY_MODS: BASE_SIZE_CM3 (int > 0)
                 HEIGHT_%: [lo, hi], 0 < lo ≤ hi
                 BROADNESS_%: [lo, hi], 0 < lo ≤ hi
      PHYS_ATT_RANGE: exactly these keys →
        STRENGTH, AGILITY, TOUGHNESS, ENDURANCE, RECUPERATION, DISEASE_RESISTANCE
      MENT_ATT_RANGE: exactly these keys →
        ANALYTICAL_ABILITY, FOCUS, WILLPOWER, MEMORY, INTUITION, LINGUISTIC_ABILITY,
        SPATIAL_SENSE, KINESTHETIC_SENSE, MUSICALITY, CREATIVITY, SOCIAL_AWARENESS,
        EMPATHY, PATIENCE
      For every attribute array:
        - length = 7
        - strictly ascending integers
        - each value in [1..5000] (allow AGILITY min=150 for DWARF)
  * No unknown attribute names.

- Skills.txt:
  * TIER_SCALE defines levels 0..11 with labels.
  * SKILL_TOKENS is a non-empty list (tokens are unique).

- ConfigManager.txt:
  * NORMAL_FALLBACK has MEAN, STD, MIN, MAX, ENABLED.
  * MIN ≤ MEAN ≤ MAX; STD > 0.

- UnitGenerator.txt:
  * States that skills initialize to 0 and uses 7-cutoff rolls.

- Evaluator_8class.txt:
  * Defines B0..B7 classes relative to c1..c7.

FAILURE MODE
- Any missing/invalid item → report path + rule broken.
- Generator may fall back to NORMAL_FALLBACK if allowed.
