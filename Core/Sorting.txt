# Sorting

PURPOSE
- Define sort keys and filter predicates for listing stored units.

SORT_KEYS
- Any attribute name (e.g., STRENGTH, FOCUS)
- Aggregates: ELITE_COUNT, HIGH_COUNT
- Meta: creature, caste, created_utc

ORDER
- asc | desc

FILTERS (grammar)
- equality:   CREATURE==DWARF
- thresholds: STRENGTH>=HIGH        # class-based
- numeric:    FOCUS>=1600
- counts:     ELITE_COUNT>=1
- caste:      CASTE==FEMALE

EVAL RULES
- Class comparisons map to bucket indices (VERY_LOW=0 â€¦ EXCEPTIONAL=7).
- Numeric comparisons use raw attribute values.
- Multiple filters combine with AND by default.
